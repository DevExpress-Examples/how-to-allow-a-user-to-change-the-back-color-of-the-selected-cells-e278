# How to allow a user to change the back color of the selected cells


<p>This example demonstrates how to change the back color of the selected cells in the XtraGrid via the dialog that's invoked by a right mouse click. To force these cells to keep their color after sorting and grouping, all info about cells is stored in the hash table.  The back color of the cells is changed within the RowCellStyle event handler.</p>
